Job Retries
===========

When a job fails, Autosubmit can automatically resubmit it up to a configurable
number of times, optionally with a delay between attempts. This page covers
job-level retries; for SSH-connection and remote-command retries, see
:ref:`ssh_retries` below.

.. note::
   The ``RETRIALS`` setting will be renamed to ``RETRIES`` in a future release
   (see `#2088 <https://github.com/BSC-ES/autosubmit/issues/2088>`_).
   ``RETRIALS`` will continue to work during the transition.

Configuration
-------------

Two settings control job retries. Both go under ``CONFIG`` in
``autosubmit_<EXPID>.yml``:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Parameter
      - Description
    * - ``RETRIALS``
      - Maximum number of retries after the first failure. Default: ``0``
        (no retries). May be overridden per job under ``JOBS.<section>.RETRIALS``
        or per wrapper under ``WRAPPERS.<section>.RETRIALS``.
    * - ``DELAY_RETRY_TIME``
      - Delay in seconds between retries. Accepts three formats — plain, ``+N``,
        and ``*N`` — described below. Default: ``-1`` (no delay; retry
        immediately).

Delay formats
-------------

``DELAY_RETRY_TIME`` accepts three syntaxes. The prefix (``+`` or ``*``, or none)
tells Autosubmit which formula to use for computing the delay before each retry.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 30 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Format
      - Formula
      - Behavior
    * - ``N``
      - constant ``N``
      - Wait ``N`` seconds before every retry.
    * - ``+N``
      - ``N × fail_count``
      - Linear growth. Wait ``N``, ``2N``, ``3N``, ... seconds.
    * - ``*N``
      - ``N × 10^(fail_count - 1)``
      - Exponential growth. Wait ``N``, ``10N``, ``100N``, ... seconds.

The ``*N`` format is a form of `exponential backoff
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff>`_, a common retry pattern
in distributed systems and workflow managers. See also
`Kestra's overview <https://kestra.io/resources/infrastructure/exponential-backoff>`_
and `OpenWorkflow's retries docs <https://openworkflow.dev/docs/retries>`_.

Worked example with ``N = 11``:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 20 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Retry #
      - ``11``
      - ``+11``
      - ``*11``
    * - 1
      - 11 s
      - 11 s
      - 11 s
    * - 2
      - 11 s
      - 22 s
      - 110 s
    * - 3
      - 11 s
      - 33 s
      - 1 100 s
    * - 4
      - 11 s
      - 44 s
      - 11 000 s

Use the plain or ``+N`` format when failures are expected to be short and
transient (e.g. brief HPC hiccups). Use ``*N`` when a longer back-off is safer,
for example when the platform may be under maintenance.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    CONFIG:
        RETRIALS: 3
        DELAY_RETRY_TIME: +30    # wait 30, 60, 90 seconds between retries

A per-job override on the retry count:

.. code-block:: yaml

    JOBS:
        POST:
            FILE: templates/post.sh
            RETRIALS: 5

Wrapper retries
---------------

Wrappers accept their own ``RETRIALS`` setting, which overrides the one on the
inner jobs. See :ref:`wrapper_retrials` for details.

Vertical wrappers retry inner jobs **inside the wrapper submission** rather
than by resubmitting the wrapper. Once a vertical wrapper's inner job has
exhausted its inner retries and the wrapper finishes, Autosubmit will not
retry that inner job again externally.

Template variables
------------------

Retry-related values are exposed as template variables that scripts can
reference:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 30 70
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Variable
      - Value
    * - ``%FAIL_COUNT%``
      - Current retry number (``0`` on first attempt, incremented on each failure).
    * - ``%RETRIALS%``
      - Configured maximum retry count for the job.

Retry log files
---------------

Each retry writes its own log files in ``LOG_<EXPID>/``, suffixed with the
attempt number:

.. code-block:: text

    <job_name>.<timestamp>.out                  # first attempt
    <job_name>.<timestamp>.err
    <job_name>.<timestamp>.out_attempt_1        # first retry
    <job_name>.<timestamp>.err_attempt_1
    <job_name>.<timestamp>.out_attempt_2        # second retry
    ...

Statistics from ``autosubmit stats`` include per-job retry counts
(``retrialCount``, ``completedCount``, ``failedCount``).

.. _ssh_retries:

SSH connection and command retries
----------------------------------

The retries described above are for **job execution**. Autosubmit also retries
at two lower levels when talking to the remote platform: SSH connections and
remote command execution.

For remote platforms, there are at least two parts where retries happen
(if you use wrappers you may have others), when Autosubmit **connects** to
the remote platform, and when Autosubmit **executes** a command.

When Autosubmit **connects** to a remote platform, it will use the ``host``
value of the platform configuration. This value can contain a single
host name, or a list of host names using commas (``,``) as separators.

Right now Autosubmit has a hard-coded number of retries for connecting
to remote platforms. It will try to connect to the platform, without
interval, **retrying connecting twice** (``2``). It will write to logs in
``INFO`` and ``WARNING`` levels information about the retries, like
whether it is retrying to connect, and what is the current retry number.

When multiple hosts are given as a comma-separated list, the first connection
attempt uses the first host in the list. If it fails, the single retry picks
at random from the remaining hosts, excluding the one that just failed.

For **executing** commands on remote platforms, Autosubmit uses another
hard-coded value of ``3`` retries, without interval between each retry.
Autosubmit will submit the command to be executed via SSH. If the command
fails on the remote platform, **Autosubmit will not retry** the command.

As an example, if you try to run an executable such as ``Rscript``, but this
executable does not exist on the remote platform, Autosubmit will log the error,
and mark the job as ``FAILED``. If the job has ``RETRIALS`` configured (see
:ref:`job_retries`), Autosubmit may then retry it according to that policy —
though a missing executable will fail identically on every retry.

However, if you have a networking issue between Autosubmit and your remote
platform, then Autosubmit will log in ``INFO`` and ``WARNING`` and will
retry executing the command up to hard-coded ``3`` retries.

Autosubmit treats network problems with a remote platform as recoverable
events. If the session drops, if the SSH transport breaks, or if a connection
or a timeout fails, Autosubmit rebuilds the connection and tries the command
again. This includes the case where the remote host closes the socket and
Paramiko raises an ``EOFError``, which used to abort the run.

To avoid idle disconnections, Autosubmit can send keepalive packets to the
remote platform. You configure this per platform with
``PLATFORMS.<name>.SSH_KEEPALIVE``, in seconds, and the default is ``30``.
Setting it to ``0`` disables keepalives. The value is how often a keepalive
packet is sent while the connection is idle. It is not a connection timeout.

If a platform keeps dropping the connection after every reconnection,
Autosubmit stops the run instead of retrying the recovery forever. You control
how many consecutive transport failures are tolerated with
``PLATFORMS.<name>.MAX_TRANSPORT_RETRIALS``, and the default is ``3``. Setting
it to ``0`` disables the limit. This protects the run when a platform stays
unreachable after several attempts.

.. note::
   The number of attempts Autosubmit makes before giving up is fixed in the
   code: ``2`` for connecting and ``3`` for executing a command. Issue
   `#986 <https://github.com/BSC-ES/autosubmit/issues/986>`_ tracks making
   those counts configurable.

For ``ecaccess`` platforms specifically, the ``-retry`` flag count on the
``ecaccess`` binary is user-configurable via ``PLATFORMS.<name>.ECACCESS_RETRIES``
(default ``100``).
