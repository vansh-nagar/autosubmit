###################
Variables reference
###################

Autosubmit uses a variable substitution system to facilitate the
development of the templates. These variables can be used on templates
with the syntax ``%VARIABLE_NAME%``.

All configuration variables that are not related to the current job
or platform are available by accessing first their parents, e.g.
``%PROJECT.PROJECT_TYPE% or %DEFAULT.EXPID%``.

You can review all variables at any given time by using the
:ref:`report <report>` command, as illustrated below.


.. code-block:: console
    :caption: Example usage of ``autosubmit report``

    $ autosubmit report <EXPID> -all

The command will save the list of variables available to a file
in the experiment area. The groups of variables of Autosubmit are
detailed in the next sections on this page.

.. note:: All the variable tables are displayed in alphabetical order.


.. note::

    Custom configuration files (e.g. ``my-file.yml``) may contain
    configuration like this example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        MYAPP:
          MYPARAMETER: 42
          ANOTHER_PARAMETER: 1984

    If you configure Autosubmit to include this file with the
    rest of your configuration, then those variables will be
    available to each job as ``%MYAPP.MYPARAMETER%`` and
    ``%MYAPP.ANOTHER_PARAMETER%``.


Job variables
=============

These variables are relatives to the current job. These variables
appear in the output of the :ref:`report <report>` command with the
pattern ``JOBS.${JOB_NAME}.${JOB_VARIABLE}=${VALUE}``. They can be used in
templates with ``%PATH_TO_JOB_VARIABLE%``.


The variables are present only in jobs that contain a date
(e.g. ``RUNNING=date``).


.. autosubmit-variables:: JOB


.. autosubmit-variables:: CHUNK


Custom directives
-----------------

There are job variables that Autosubmit automatically converts into
directives for your batch server. For example, ``THREADS`` will
be set in a Slurm platform as ``--SBATCH --cpus-per-task=$THREADS``.

However, the variables in Autosubmit do not contain all the directives
available in each platform like Slurm. For values that do not have a
direct variable, you can use ``CUSTOM_DIRECTIVES`` to define them in
your target platform. For instance, to set the number of GPU's in a Slurm
job, you can use ``CUSTOM_DIRECTIVES=--gpus-per-node=10``.


Runtime template variables
==========================

The ``%VARIABLE%`` substitutions described above are resolved before the job
script is submitted. Some values, however, are only known once the job is
actually running on the platform. Autosubmit injects those values directly
into the generated script, so they are available from your template code at
runtime, but they **cannot** be used with the ``%VARIABLE%`` syntax.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Variable
      - Description
    * - ``AS_JOB_ID``
      - Identifier assigned by the batch scheduler to the running job.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Bash

    echo "This job runs with AS_JOB_ID=$AS_JOB_ID"

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Python

    print(f"This job runs with AS_JOB_ID={AS_JOB_ID}")

.. code-block:: r
    :caption: R

    cat("This job runs with AS_JOB_ID=", AS_JOB_ID, "\n", sep = "")


Platform variables
==================

Platform variables come from the ``PLATFORMS`` section of the configuration
files. Each ``JOBS`` entry can reference any of these platforms via its
``PLATFORM`` key. If no platform is specified, the job uses the experiment's
default platform (``DEFAULT.HPCARCH``).

There are three ways platform variables reach your job templates: raw keys, 
``HPC``-prefixed keys, and ``CURRENT_``-prefixed keys.

Example configuration
---------------------

Consider the following experiment configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    DEFAULT:
      EXPID: a000
      HPCARCH: PS

    PLATFORMS:
      MARENOSTRUM5:
        TYPE: slurm
        HOST: glogin1.bsc.es, glogin2.bsc.es
        USER: root
        PROJECT: bsc32
        SCRATCH_DIR: /gpfs/scratch
      SLURM:
        TYPE: slurm
        HOST: slurm-test
        USER: root
        PROJECT: group
        SCRATCH_DIR: /tmp/scratch
      PS:
        TYPE: pbs
        HOST: ps-test
        USER: root
        PROJECT: bsc-es
        SCRATCH_DIR: /tmp/scratch


    JOBS:
      SIM:
        FILE: sim.sh
        RUNNING: once
        PLATFORM: MARENOSTRUM5
      POST:
        FILE: post.sh
        RUNNING: once
        PLATFORM: SLURM
      LOCAL_JOB:
        FILE: local_test.sh
        RUNNING: once
         # No PLATFORM key, uses DEFAULT.HPCARCH (PS)

In this example:

* ``SIM`` uses ``MARENOSTRUM5`` as its platform, so it will have access to all the keys under
  ``PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5``.
* ``POST`` uses ``SLURM`` as its platform, so it will have access to all the keys under
  ``PLATFORMS.SLURM``.
* ``LOCAL_JOB`` does not specify a platform, so it will use the default platform
  ``DEFAULT.HPCARCH`` (``PS``). It will have access to all the keys under ``PLATFORMS.PS``.

---

**1. Raw platform keys (global)**

Every key under a platform is available globally as ``PLATFORMS.<PLATFORM_ID>.<KEY>``.
You can reference them in templates as ``%PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.HOST%`` for example.

In the output of :ref:`report <report>` you will find them with the pattern 
``PLATFORMS.<PLATFORM_ID>.<KEY>=<VALUE>``.

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: Excerpt from ``autosubmit report a000 -all``

    PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.TYPE=slurm
    PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.HOST=glogin1.bsc.es, glogin2.bsc.es
    PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.USER=root
    PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.PROJECT=bsc32
    PLATFORMS.MARENOSTRUM5.SCRATCH_DIR=/gpfs/scratch
    PLATFORMS.SLURM.TYPE=slurm
    ...

---

**2. HPC prefixed keys (default platform, global)**

Every key under the **default** platform (``DEFAULT.HPCARCH``) is available
with an ``HPC`` prefix. These are also global, as they have the same value for every job.

From the example above (default platform is ``PS``):

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 25 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Template variable
      - Source key
      - Value
    * - ``%HPCHOST%``
      - ``HOST``
      - ``ps-test``
    * - ``%HPCUSER%``
      - ``USER``
      - ``root``
    * - ``%HPCPROJECT%``
      - ``PROJECT``
      - ``bsc-es``
    * - ``%HPCSCRATCH_DIR%``
      - ``SCRATCH_DIR``
      - ``/tmp/scratch``

.. note::

    The key name is used as-is. E.g. ``HPCPROJECT`` (not ``HPCPROJ``).
    If you add a custom key to your platform (e.g. ``GPU_MODEL: A100``),
    it becomes available as ``%HPCGPU_MODEL%``.

In addition, Autosubmit automatically computes the following derived variables:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Variable
      - Description
    * - **HPCARCH**
      - Name of the default platform (``PS``).
    * - **HPCROOTDIR**
      - ``<SCRATCH_DIR>/<PROJECT>/<USER>/<EXPID>``
        e.g. ``/tmp/scratch/bsc-es/root/a000``.
    * - **HPCLOGDIR**
      - ``<HPCROOTDIR>/LOG_<EXPID>``
        e.g. ``/tmp/scratch/bsc-es/root/a000/LOG_a000``.

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: Excerpt from ``autosubmit report a000 -all``

    HPCARCH=PS
    HPCHOST=ps-test
    HPCLOGDIR=/tmp/scratch/bsc-es/root/a000/LOG_a000
    HPCPROJECT=bsc-es
    HPCROOTDIR=/tmp/scratch/bsc-es/root/a000
    HPCSCRATCH_DIR=/tmp/scratch
    HPCUSER=root

---

**3. CURRENT_ prefixed keys (per-job)**

Each job has access to the keys of its own platform (the one it runs on)
with a ``CURRENT_`` prefix. This means different jobs may have different
values for the same ``CURRENT_<KEY>`` variable.

Continuing with the example above:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 25 25 25
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Template variable
      - In ``SIM``
      - In ``POST``
      - In ``LOCAL_JOB``
    * - ``%CURRENT_HOST%``
      - ``glogin1.bsc.es, glogin2.bsc.es``
      - ``slurm-test``
      - ``ps-test``
    * - ``%CURRENT_USER%``
      - ``root``
      - ``root``
      - ``root``
    * - ``%CURRENT_PROJECT%``
      - ``bsc32``
      - ``group``
      - ``bsc-es``
    * - ``%CURRENT_SCRATCH_DIR%``
      - ``/gpfs/scratch``
      - ``/tmp/scratch``
      - ``/tmp/scratch``

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: Excerpt from ``autosubmit report a000 -all``

    JOBS.LOCAL_JOB.CURRENT_HOST=ps-test
    JOBS.LOCAL_JOB.CURRENT_PROJECT=bsc-es
    JOBS.POST.CURRENT_HOST=slurm-test
    JOBS.POST.CURRENT_PROJECT=group
    JOBS.SIM.CURRENT_HOST=glogin1.bsc.es, glogin2.bsc.es
    JOBS.SIM.CURRENT_PROJECT=bsc32

The ``CURRENT_`` prefix is also populated from the job's section keys 
(``JOBS.<section>``). This allows you to inject job-specific information 
into your templates.

**Auto-generated CURRENT_ variables**

Below is a list of the auto-generated ``CURRENT_`` variables that are available in each job.
These are always available regardless of the raw YAML keys defined.

.. autosubmit-variables:: platform


.. note::
    The table above lists the ``CURRENT_`` variables that Autosubmit 
    exposes from the platform section. Not all of them are always
    populated. Some are filled automatically by Autosubmit, others
    come from the YAML configuration, and a few are only used by certain
    schedulers.

    * ``CURRENT_ARCH``, ``CURRENT_HOST``, ``CURRENT_TYPE``,
      ``CURRENT_SCRATCH_DIR``, ``CURRENT_ROOTDIR``,
      ``CURRENT_LOGDIR`` and ``CURRENT_HYPERTHREADING`` are
      **automatically** filled by Autosubmit.
    
    * ``CURRENT_USER``, ``CURRENT_PROJ``, ``CURRENT_QUEUE``,
      ``CURRENT_PARTITION`` and ``CURRENT_TEMP_DIR`` are only
      filled if the corresponding YAML key (``USER``,
      ``PROJECT``, ``QUEUE``, ``PARTITION``, ``TEMP_DIR``) is
      defined in the platform configuration. On the LOCAL
      platform they remain empty.

    * ``CURRENT_BUDG``, ``CURRENT_RESERVATION`` and
      ``CURRENT_EXCLUSIVITY`` are only populated if the
      corresponding YAML keys (``BUDGET``, ``RESERVATION``,
      ``EXCLUSIVITY``) are defined in the platform configuration.
      They are only used by certain schedulers: ``CURRENT_BUDG`` 
      is used by the ECMWF header, ``CURRENT_RESERVATION`` by 
      SLURM and PBS, and ``CURRENT_EXCLUSIVITY`` by SLURM.
