### 4.2.0: Minor release

This is a minor release of Autosubmit that introduces significant changes in the
management of jobs and dependencies. The main highlight of this release is the
introduction of a new database backend for the joblist using SQLAlchemy, which
allows for better scalability in handling large workflows. This release also includes
several bug fixes and enhancements to improve the overall user experience.

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix `autosubmit.lock` not being deleted after `create` and `run`; `archive` and `delete` now acquire it too #3033 #3055
- Fix multi-member PJM job lookup output parsing #3255 (thanks @1cbyc)
- Remove the unrelated `--filter_status` option from `autosubmit expid` #3241 (thanks @1cbyc)
- Fixed `DELAY_RETRY_TIME` not matching the documented `+N` and `*N` delay sequences #3138
- Fix timeout guard is silently disabled for login/local jobs #3081
- Fix CI ruff lint job failing on deleted files or single-commited branches #3166
- Fix `clean` command to correctly delete files with `--stats` and `--plots` #3254 (thanks @Ha1baraA11)
- Fix `RERUN` failing with `TypeError` on `get_job_related()` during `create` #3295
- Fix `autosubmit run` crashing with an unhandled `EOFError` when a platform drops the SSH session during job submission #3309
- Removed a duplicate Subversion checkout #3310 (thanks @ShivanshShukla)

**New Features:**

- Allow local project paths to use `~` for the user's home directory #3296 (thanks @fatihcvs)
- Introduced SQLAlchemy as the main database backend for joblist management, replacing the
  previous pickle-based system. This change allows for better scalability and flexibility in
  handling large workflows.
- Added support for PostgreSQL as a database backend, in addition to the default SQLite.
  This provides users with more options for database management.
- Improved the performance of job and dependency management, especially for large workflows with thousands of jobs.
- Allow recovery to update current running/ready jobs #1251
- `autosubmit` Bash autocomplete #1227 #3171
- Added "Did you mean 'run'" when an unknown sub-command is similar (e.g., "rum") to a valid one. #3194 #3171
- Added platform options `SSH_KEEPALIVE` (seconds of inactivity before sending a keepalive packet, default `30`) and `MAX_TRANSPORT_RETRIALS` (consecutive SSH transport failures tolerated before stopping the run, default `3`) #3309

**Migration from `job_list.pkl` to Database**

- All data has been migrated from the `job_list.pkl` file to a database, marking a system shift that resulted
  in significant changes to the code.

**Memory and Performance Improvements**:

- Significant reduction in memory usage by loading only necessary jobs and dependencies for active employment.
- Enhanced performance during autosubmit runs and ongoing improvements to the log process management
  through direct database interactions to reduce the communication with the main process.
- Overall job management features have been improved to ensure better tracking and status updates,
  removing redundant code to enhance the efficiency of a loop 
- The recovery and set status commands have been improved for version 4.2.0 and later 4.1.16,
  resulting in faster operations.
- Removal of _COMPLETED files to reduce the amount of inodes generated
- A significant rework of the wrapper building process has been implemented to address ongoing issues
  and prevent regressions, particularly with 2D wrappers.
- Various functions have been optimized to minimize calls to save/load operations, enhancing the
  software's overall efficiency and responsiveness.

**Enhancements**

- **Database Method Enhancements**: Support for both PostgreSQL and SQLite with optimised save/load mechanisms.
  Improved wrapper data storage and load.
- **Testing Efforts**: Tests have been added for every rework to enhance reliability, with a particular effort
  on integration tests.
- Enforce connection pool usage when using PostgreSQL as database backend #2973
- Auto-detect git default branch when `-b` flag not specified #3101
- Removed `files` arguments from autosubmit sub-commands, and moved code to upgrade scripts out of `autosubmit.py` #2711
- `autosubmit.py` file was deleted and its 5K lines of code were moved into separated files #973 #1046 #3171 #3172
- `autosubmit --help` now shows better description, and lists available subcommands #3171
- The documentation of CLI commands are synced automatically with the Sphinx docs #3171 #1344
- Most `autosubmit` sub-commands now support the `--profiler`` to run with cProfile #1094 #3171
- Every command now prints traceability information (AS/Python version, Linux, user name, ...) #2795 #3171
- set_status now rejects active targets (SUBMITTED/QUEUING/RUNNING → AutosubmitCritical 7011). #3231
- Centralized Job.apply_status / Status.ACTIVE/RE_RUNNABLE #3231
- Stale-data recovery on set-status runs only for final targets (_FINAL_STATUSES) in job/manage.py
  instead of the autosubmit.py monolith. #3231
- Jobs not in memory (finished in a prior run) are resolved from the DB and persisted directly
  (with edge-completion reconciliation), never loaded into the graph. #3231

### 4.1.17.1: Bug fixes and enhancements (#3181)

**Bug fixes:**

- Fewer "key-exchange timed out" errors on busy cluster login servers. Autosubmit now waits longer and recovers by itself.
- `recovery` no longer stops when a platform can't say which jobs finished; offline it falls back to its own records.
- The `updated_list_<EXPID>.txt` status file is now friendlier: bad lines are skipped with a warning, job names and statuses are case-insensitive, and it can't break your run.
- Autosubmit no longer gets stuck on logs of jobs whose info was lost after an interrupted run.
- Relaunching a finished job from the `updated_list` file now correctly resets some variables used to download the logs
- The default for IO_SAFE_WAIT is set back to 60 seconds

**Enhancements:**

- New `CLEAR_TO_SEND_TIMEOUT` platform setting: how long to wait for a busy login server. Default: 180 seconds.
- When you change the status of a job that is still running, Autosubmit stops it on the cluster first and then applies the change. No more accidental duplicate runs.
- `setstatus` and `updated_list` no longer let you put a job into an in-progress state like submitted, queuing, or running. Autosubmit manages those states on its own.
- QOL: `updated_list` and `setstatus` now call the same functions to manage status.
- Improved provenance documentation, describing the inputs, outputs, how options are merged, etc. #3232

### 4.1.17: Bug fixes and enhancements

**Bug fixes:**

- Fixed `%CHUNK%` always resolving to 1 for jobs with `SYNCHRONIZE: date` #3087
- Fixed wrapper deadlock false positive when non-wrapped jobs are still
  active or could become ready later #3084
- Fixed leftover wrapper batch stuck on MIN_WRAPPED when remaining
  jobs are blocked by the same package #3084
- Fixed autosubmit describe warning about non-experiment directories (e.g. logs, archive folders) by enumerating experiments from the database instead of scanning the root directory #1110

### 4.1.16: Postgres (experimental) support, bug fixes, and enhancements

This release adds support to Postgres using SQLAlchemy, without removing the
SQLite support. By default, Autosubmit will use SQLite. Postgres support is
experimental and not recommended for production yet.

Autosubmit Config Parser code has been merged back into this code base. LOCAL
platform does not support wrappers anymore (it was used for testing).

The `--notransitive` argument has been deprecated in all commands. You may still
use it without a failure, but there will be a warning displayed asking you to
update your command line. This argument will be completely removed on a later
release.

**Bug fixes:**

### 4.1.15: Bug fixes, enhancements, and new features

The filter `-fp` of the command `autosubmit stats` changed in this release.
Previously, a `-fp 0` would not raise any errors, and would bring all the
jobs, just like when no filter is provided. Now both negative numbers and
`0` (zero) raise an error, and only values greater than `0` are used to compute
the filter the jobs. Not using any value for `-fp` still returns all jobs.

**Bug fixes:**

- Corrected the logic for handling `ZombieProcess` errors in `psutil` calls done in `autosubmit stop`, which
  prevented the command from working correctly if the experiment process appeared after a zombie in the list #2394
- Fixed an issue with Autosubmit's CITATION.cff that prevented Zenodo from automatically
  adding new deposits via its webhook #2401
- Deleted command `autosubmit test` that was not working in Autosubmit 4 #2386

- Log levels in the command line now accept `ERROR` #2412
- Fix setstatus command to work in all cases #2381
- Fix PS platform to work with the local machine #2374
- Fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` when using RO-Crate or `stats`, and also an issue
  where the message said `None` could not be iterable. #2389
